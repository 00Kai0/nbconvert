Converting Notebooks to Other Formats
=====================================

The ``nbconvert`` tool allows you to convert an ``.ipynb`` notebook
document file into various static formats. It can also execute notebooks
programmatically.

``nbconvert`` is both a python library and a command line tool (invoked as
``jupyter nbconvert ...``).
The ``nbconvert`` library is also used to implement the 'Download as' feature within the
Jupyter Notebook web app.
