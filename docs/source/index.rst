Converting Notebooks to Other Formats
=====================================

Originally added to IPython in version 1.0 (and moved to Jupyter in the 4.0
release), the ``nbconvert`` tool allows you to convert an ``.ipynb`` notebook
document file into various static formats.

Currently, ``nbconvert`` is provided as a command line tool, run as a script
using Jupyter. A direct export capability from within the
Jupyter Notebook web app is planned.
